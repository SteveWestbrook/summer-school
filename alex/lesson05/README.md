# Lesson 5 - A cat!

You may have started this lesson already, but here are some tips to make sure you get the right outcome.

You'll want to open pinta, and make a 16x16 image with a transparent background.  Make a cat, which we're going to show on the web page later.

To save, hit Ctrl-S.  You'll want to make sure that you save the cat picture in the same directory as your other files (index.html and game.js).  It should be ~/programming/cats.  You'll also want to make sure that your cat has a transparent background, so near the bottom right part of the window that pops up when you go to save your cat, change the thing that says "JPEG image" to "PNG image".  You can change it by clicking on it.  When you've changed that, call the file cat.png and hit OK at the bottom right of the window.

Next we'll be displaying our cat on the screen.
