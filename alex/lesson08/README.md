# LESSON 8 - Preparing some more artwork

First thing we'll do today is give our cat an extra image so that it can walk.  Here's how you do that:

1. Open your cat.png in pinta.  We're going to resize the picture while keeping the cat the same size, and then we're going to make a nearly identical cat on the new part of the image.
2. Put a black dot on the bottom right pixel.  This will tell you where your original image ends.
3. Resize the canvas.  You'll want to follow the instructions in https://learnubuntumate.weebly.com/image-size.html.  Make sure you resize the CANVAS and not the IMAGE, because you don't want your cat picture to stretch.  The new size should be 32 pixels wide by 16 pixels high.
4. Select your original 16x16 picture - from the top left to the black pixel in the bottom right (including the black pixel).  Ctrl-c to copy it.
5. Paste (Ctrl+v) and drage the new cat to the other part of the picture on the right.  Make sure the black dot is now at the very bottom right of the image.
6. Now, change the new cat so that its legs have moved.

Once you're done, save.  The site will now show two cats next to each other - don't worry.

# Adding some background
You can also spend some time putting together things for the cat to jump over.  Make sure to make them with a transparent background and save them as png files, or they will have a black background.  If you make a few obstacles, maybe add a sun for the sky or something like that.  When you're done, save them all with different file names in the ~/programming/cats directory.
