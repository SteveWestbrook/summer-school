LESSON 06 - A story outline
You have been writing a story so far; I wonder if you have thought about where it is going, how long it will be, and how it will end.  Today, before you write your 500 words, take a look at setting up a story outline.

You'll want first to think about the things that will happen during the story.  Where does it start, how does it end, how do you get to the end?  Fill in the individual events that happen.  At this point your work will begin - you will want to think about how each event contributes to getting you to the end - ask yourself, "what is the point of this event?  Does it line up with the rest of the story?"  One of the most jarring things in a story or movie is for something "pointless" to happen - that is, something that does not contribute to the plot or theme in a meaningful way.  Probably the most common example of this is a romantic subplot that exists solely for the main character to seem attractive - people are being chased by laser robots for an hour and suddenly they drop everything to declare their love for one another.  But even seemingly innocuous scenes can fail this test, so be on the lookout.  You may find that you have an event that foreshadows something that in the final version never actually happens - that among other things should go.

This is all rambling and it is debatable that creative writing can be taught at all, since the people teaching are more like critics than authors.  But you can at least avoid beginner mistakes while you figure out for yourself how to string together a compelling story.

After you have done this, and ruthlessly analyzed every last little bit, go back and edit your story in accordance with the outline.

This process should take you most of the day.  If it doesn't, you are quite likely too impressed by your own genius.
