## Review of your work so far

The first thing I notice is that you could benefit from adding more exposition here and there.  Here are a couple of examples:

"Then I realised, this was my last day here."

This feels wrong, and it takes some effort to explain why.  But consider that this person has spent considerable time waiting to get out of the position he's in - the day he finally gets away isn't something that comes into his mind as an incidental thought: he won't "realize" that he's about to leave, because it's something he's been waiting for for a long time.  He's looking forward to it.

I can't tell you what to put in the place of this sentence, but I would consider how you would feel about being able to leave a menial job you hated after several years.  You open with "I could feel it in my bones" - maybe you can bind together the character's sensation of something strange happening in space with their personal achievement of being able to leave their job.  That kind of thing helps when putting together a story: one part should compliment another.

Another example:

"It melted and repaired my tablet."

This is something that just happens in video games, but in real life, the rapid conversion of metal to a finished computer would be quite an impressive feat to modern eyes.  It might be perfectly normal to the character, but when something weird and surprising like this happens, you need to ease the reader into it; you need to spend some time describing what happens, and being specific about how raw materials are miraculously transformed into a finished product.  Don't try to rush through it.  That sort of thing will take a while to explain.

It should take you a fairly long time to get through those two passages.  No, really.  If it's 11 AM and you've decided you're done, you're not trying hard enough.  Go back and do it properly.

If you do finish, and come up with passages that you're really proud of, go through the story thinking like this, and see what else strikes you as unnatural or under-explained.  There will be plenty to go through.
