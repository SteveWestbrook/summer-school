# NEW LESSON - Creative Writing 

Beside your computer you should see an anthology of science fiction from 1996.  You can read whatever you like, but I suggest starting with "The Lady Vanishes" on page 362 and "Chrysalis" on page 373.  Each has a distinctive style which I think will be illustrative as well as entertaining.

The first author, whose name esacpes me at the moment, is getting at something with this story; he is trying to communicate a point.  Look at how he approaches doing so, both on a high level and in little details.

The second author, Robert Reed, is well-known for creating interesting environments, although he often neglects to sufficiently flesh out the plots of the stories for which he has prepared these fascinating settings.  As you read, consider his style and compare it with that of the previous author.

Once you have read each story, come up with a few hundred words of your own in the style of each author.  Or meld them together if you like, or come up with some completely new style if you would prefer.  At any rate, put together a small enough piece of work that you can go through it and ruthlessly edit and clean it up when you are finished.
